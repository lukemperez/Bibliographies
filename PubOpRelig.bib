@article{Philpott2016,
abstract = { Not so very long ago, the idea of religious freedom enjoyed all the self-evident virtue of a Norman Rockwell painting. Sure, Americans disagreed about what it meant in practice, leaving their Supreme Court to hash out the details. Still, however Americans differed in their religious beliefs, they espoused religious freedom and insisted that it cannot be government's job to promote any one religious sect over others or coerce anyone's conscience in religious matters. “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,” thundered Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson in 1943, “it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” 1 For a time, this consensus seemed poised to embrace the entire world. When in November 1949 Eleanor Roosevelt proudly held up for public view a poster-size copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its article on “freedom of thought, conscience and religion,” one might have been forgiven for thinking that all the peoples of the earth were ready to follow her matronly instruction. 2 },

@article{Wald2016,
abstract = {T o judge by the absence of religion from the pages of the American Political Science Review in its first century, most political scientists have embraced a secular understanding of the political world. We explore the evolving status of religion in the discipline by examining patterns of scholarly inquiry in the discipline's flagship journal. After finding religion an (at best) marginal topic and rejecting some plausible hypotheses for this outcome, we examine the major reasons religion has received so little attention— –the intellectual origins of the discipline, the social background of practitioners, the complexity of religious measurements, and the event-driven agenda of political science. Despite the resurgence of scholarly interest in religion during the 1980s, the status of the subfield remains tenuous because of the intellectual isolation of research on the topic. R ooted in moral philosophy, modern social sci-ence owes much to the reformist zeal of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. (See Figure 1 for graphic evidence.) The many pioneers in sociology, economics, and political science who had strong religious backgrounds, who often were them-selves clergy or children of clergymen, attest to the in-fluence of the Social Gospel in the early behavioral sci-ences (Blum 1956; Fox 1993; Reed 1981; Ross 1991). As political science became a professional academic disci-pline, responding to the imperatives of the academy and scientific specialization, the religious and mis-sionary zeal that characterized the early years waned (Somit and Tannenhaus 1967). Although political sci-entists in fields like political philosophy and public law continued to explore religion and public order, there was much less interest in religion among the profession as a whole, especially when the behavioral approach gained ascendance after World War II. Work on reli-gion was largely relegated to the margins of the disci-pline, not to return until the 1980s. Using the Review as a case study, we examine the trajectory of scholarship on religion in politics.},

@misc{Philpott2007,
abstract = {This essay takes on the broad question-what explains the political pursuits of religious actors?-by exploring two powerful influences on these pursuits The first is differentiation, or the degree of autonomy between religious actors and states in their basic authority. The second is political theology, the set of ideas that religious actors hold about political authority and justice. Through global comparisons across religions, regions, and states, it seeks to establish the effect of both influences on two political pursuits in which religion's role is hotly debated today: support for democratization and political violence, including communal violence and terrorism. It concludes with lessons learned commonly from the analysis of both pursuits.},

@article{Tepe2011,
abstract = {In this analysis, we expand the debate on the place of religion in political science by using the predictions of Wald and Wilcox as our starting point. Following in their footsteps, we ask how political scientists have studied Islam since 2002 and identify the studies on Islam and Muslims at the flagship conference of the discipline, the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. We evaluate not only the quantity but also the approaches employed by these studies. In order to gauge the balancing of roles (or lack thereof) between the discipline and area studies, we also take a closer look at the Middle East Studies Association, the largest association focused on the Middle East, North Africa and the Islamic world and its annual meetings during the same period. Our findings suggest that, unless carefully addressed, the prevailing patterns are likely to result in a crippling knowledge gap among political scientists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Religion and Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.},

@incollection{George2016,
abstract = {One of the dubious achievements of the Obama administration has been to put the issue of religious freedom and the rights of conscience back on the agenda in American politics. Most notoriously, the administration sought to impose upon private employers, including religious people and even religious institutions, a requirement to provide health insurance coverage that includes abortion-inducing drugs, sterilizations, and contraceptives, even if the employer cannot, as a matter of conscience, comply. The administration's mandates were challenged on under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) by employers seeking exemptions for themselves and others who conscientiously object, and the Supreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell required the administration to grant the exemptions. Of course, the administration contended and continues to contend that its mandates do not violate religious freedom or the rights of conscience, properly understood. Indeed, its defenders argue that the mandates - which contain only the narrowest of exemptions - are necessary to protect the freedom and rights of conscience of women who wish to use contraceptives and abortifacient drugs such as “Ella” (some of which they deny are actually abortion-inducing), or to avail themselves of sterilization procedures. So we find people on both sides in the debate claiming to be the defenders of liberty and conscience. It would be well for us, then, to pause to reflect in a philosophically rigorous way on the moral foundations of competing concepts of liberty and conscience. To that end, we might consider the ideas of two of modern intellectual history's most distinguished thinkers - John Stuart Mill and John Henry Newman. Mill and Newman were the greatest English intellectuals of the nineteenth century. They were men of deep and wide learning and formidable intelligence. Both wrote powerful defenses of freedom. Mill's was in the form of an essay entitled simply “On Liberty” (1859). There he defended what he described as “one very simple principle [that is] entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion.” That principle has been dubbed Mill's “harm principle:".},

@article{Kettell2012,
abstract = {A common complaint from political scientists involved in the study of religion is that religious issues have been largely overlooked by political science. Through a content analysis of leading political science and sociology journals from 2000 to 2010, this article considers the extent of this claim. The results show that political science publications involving religious topics have been significantly fewer than those engaging with subjects typically regarded as being more central to the discipline, and markedly less numerous than religious articles in leading sociology publications. Where political science publications have engaged with religious issues, these articles have also focused on a limited number of subject areas and been concentrated in specific disciplinary subfields. The proportion of articles covering religion has shown no real increase since the turn of the century. These findings underpin calls for political scientists to take religious issues more seriously.

abstract = {In the wake of marriage equality for same-sex couples, many states have introduced and passed laws that provide religious exemptions for certain services and benefits for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) persons. The authors use data from a general population survey of Nebraskans as a mixed-methods case study to examine public opinion of religious freedom laws. Drawing on data from both closed-ended (n = 1,117) and open-ended (n = 838) questions, the authors show that opposition to religious freedom laws is quite high, as 64 percent of respondents report that they oppose laws that would allow business owners to deny services to gay men and lesbians. The authors outline how both sides rely on frameworks that are foundational to the American experience: the protection of rights and the capitalist economy. The authors argue that these appeals to broad American values underscore why these bills will continue to be introduced and seen as controversial despite low levels of support.},

abstract = {We address a pressing substantive issue as well as evaluate several methodologies in this article. Substantively, we ask whether the U.S. State Department has a clear understanding of the level of cross-national religious intolerance that triggers daily headlines around the globe. Methodologically, we ask whether data on social attitudes coded from systematic qualitative reports can reliably represent cross-national public opinion. We empirically address these questions by comparing cross-national levels of religious intolerance coded from the State Department's annual international religious freedom reports with relevant population survey data from the World Values Survey and the Pew Research Center, as well as with data from written interviews of country experts conducted by the Hudson Institute. The results indicate that the understanding of social religious intolerance embodied in the State Department reports is comparable with the results of population surveys and individual expert opinion. Methodologically, this suggests that cross-national public opinion survey data can be cross-validated with coded data from systematic qualitative analysis as well as with expert opinion.
