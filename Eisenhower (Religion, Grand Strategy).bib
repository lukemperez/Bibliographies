abstract = {[History Abstract]: Examines the confrontation between the Catholic Church and the Communist Party in Hungary during 1945-48. The intractable personality and vehement anticommunism of recently appointed Cardinal J{\'{o}}zsef Mindszenty exacerbated tensions between the Church and the state. Mindszenty refused to cooperate with the Communist Party, using his religious influence on the Hungarian population to obstruct Communist political and education initiatives. Such actions made it easier for Hungarian Communists to brand Catholic Church officials as reactionary, eroded whatever chance there was for a modus vivendi between the two groups, and ultimately landed Mindszenty in prison. Mindszenty's resistance and the reactions of Communist authorities in Budapest and Moscow suggest that contemporaries did not view the eventual official Communist takeover in Hungary as inevitable immediately after World War II. Documentation: Based on documents in Russian and Hungarian archives, published documents, periodicals, and secondary sources; 73 notes.},

abstract = {Recent commentary on the apparent inability of the United States to formu- late a clear, consistent grand strategy evokes the question whether such an undertaking is possible for a democracy like the United States. This article examines the National Security Council (NSC) mechanism of the Eisenhower administration. In contrast to the general belief that the Eisenhower NSC was a bureaucratic paper mill, presided over by an affable but phlegmatic president, the reality is that the organization was dynamic and industrious. Astoundingly, the Eisenhower Presidency was unique in its approach to formulating national security policy and the only administration to publish a comprehensive basic national security policy.},

abstract = {AbstrAct: Dwight D. Eisenhower infused deliberate planning pro-cesses into US grand strategy. Due to lack of consensus regarding how to address the Soviet threat, Eisenhower directed the formation of a six-week exercise (Solarium) to study three alternative strate-gies. Upon completion of the exercise, the National Security Coun-cil crafted the Basic National Security Policy over a period of three months, reviewing it annually and revising it as the international se-curity environment changed. A s remarkable as it may seem, the only time the United States has had a formal grand strategy was during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration. While some might scoff, recalling the National Security Council Report (NSC) 68, Flexible Response as implemented by President John F. Kennedy, and a host of other doc-trines associated with presidents, none of these came close to assessing the strategic environment, developing and vetting various strategic options, and articulating an overarching strategic concept that promoted and protected US interests in a purposeful manner. A product of the US Army's deliberative planning process, President Dwight D. Eisenhower brought a wealth of executive experience, orga-nizational skill, and knowledge of strategy development to the White House. His first fundamental task as president was to design a National Security Council system to serve his leadership and management style needs. Once the NSC mechanism began to function in March 1953, Eisenhower had a system that provided him and the NSC with inte-grated staff work, education on the issues, and meaningful debate—all of which cultivated strategic thinking. The development of the Basic National Security Policy (BNSP) was a much more involved process than many consider. It began with a six-week exercise (the Solarium Project), studying alternative policies to counter the Soviet objective of world domination. Upon completion of the exercise, the real work began with the NSC Planning Board and NSC Staff providing drafts over the next three months for NSC discus-sion. The final product was NSC 162/2—the BNSP. Contrary to popular speculation at the time, the BNSP continued to evolve throughout the Eisenhower administration as the strategic environment changed. The final section of this article explores some of the mischaracterizations and realities associated with the BNSP.},

abstract = {We're often told that the United States is, was, and always has been a Christian nation. But in One Nation Under God, historian Kevin M. Kruse reveals that the idea of “Christian America” is an invention—and a relatively recent one at that.As Kruse argues, the belief that America is fundamentally and formally a Christian nation originated in the 1930s when businessmen enlisted religious activists in their fight against FDR's New Deal. Corporations from General Motors to Hilton Hotels bankrolled conservative clergymen, encouraging them to attack the New Deal as a program of “pagan statism” that perverted the central principle of Christianity: the sanctity and salvation of the individual. Their campaign for “freedom under God” culminated in the election of their close ally Dwight Eisenhower in 1952.But this apparent triumph had an ironic twist. In Eisenhower's hands, a religious movement born in opposition to the government was transformed into one that fused faith and the federal government as never before. During the 1950s, Eisenhower revolutionized the role of religion in American political culture, inventing new traditions from inaugural prayers to the National Prayer Breakfast. Meanwhile, Congress added the phrase “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and made “In God We Trust” the country's first official motto. With private groups joining in, church membership soared to an all-time high of 69{\%}. For the first time, Americans began to think of their country as an officially Christian nation.During this moment, virtually all Americans—across the religious and political spectrum—believed that their country was “one nation under God.”  But as Americans moved from broad generalities to the details of issues such as school prayer, cracks began to appear. Religious leaders rejected this “lowest common denomination” public religion, leaving conservative political activists to champion it alone. In Richard Nixon's hands, a politics that conflated piety and patriotism became sole property of the right.Provocative and authoritative, One Nation Under God reveals how the unholy alliance of money, religion, and politics created a false origin story that continues to define and divide American politics to this day.},

abstract = {Scholars have sought to shoehorn American foreign policy into the distinctly European theories of liberalism, realism, or nationalism that are taught in International Relations courses. But America's first grand strategy, as articulated in Washington's Farewell Address in 1796, blended such views in a distinctly American way. The widespread belief that this address counsels isolationism is wrong. Washington instead argues on behalf of an America that stands for moderation and independence in our international engagements. His legacy is evident nearly two centuries later in Eisenhower's Farewell Address in 1961. These statesmen embody the distinctive quality of American strategy that balances and blends seemingly rival principles to avoid extremes of injustice and imprudence. Tocqueville's praise of Washington's grand strategy affirms its deeper philosophical roots, as distinct from mere pragmatism. In his address, Eisenhower adapted the Washingtonian approach, blending interests and justice, prudence and principles, and power and pacific benevolence-to advocate our global leadership as America's enlightened self-interest.},

@article{Kirby2017,
abstract = {and Keywords American propaganda cast the Cold War as one of history's great religious wars, between the godless and the God-fearing, between good and evil. It was a simplistic depiction that was supported and promoted in the highest echelons of government and by the leaders of America's key institutions. During the course of the presidencies of Harry S. Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, U.S.-Soviet rivalry was transformed from a traditional great power struggle into a morality play that drew on firmly entrenched notions rooted in the American past, above all American exceptionalism and its sense of mission. Truman made religion America's ideological justification for abandoning America's wartime cooperation with the Soviet Union. Eisenhower used religion to persuade the world that America was a force for good in the international arena. The resulting anti-communist crusade was to have profound consequences for Christian America, contributing to both religious revival and religious repression in the early Cold War period. Over time it caused irrevocable alterations to America's religious landscape. The anti-communist dynamic unleashed embraced anti-liberalism and was a factor in the rise of the Christian Right and the decline in America's mainstream churches. In addition, the image of a godless and evil enemy dictated an irreconcilable conflict that precluded the very modes of diplomacy and discourse that might have helped avoid the worst excesses, costs, and consequences of the Cold War.},
