abstract = {Realism is as grounded in ethics and morality as other analytical and policy approaches to international politics. Realists think as deeply about moral questions as others, and their fundamental virtue of prudence as well as their consideration of the interests of others produces moderation in action. Without a vision of their own, realists lack zealotry, thus often causing less harm than ideological and moralistic advocates of strong action.},

@article{Robinson2007b,
abstract = {This article examines the role of honour as a spur to virtue. Noting the traditional division of honour into external and internal elements, the article associates the former with Aristotle's concept of 'magnanimity' and the latter with the modern preference for 'integrity'. It then argues that magnanimity should indeed be considered a virtue, and that integrity should not be considered an absolute. Both magnanimity and integrity encourage other virtues, but they can also encourage vice. An ethic of honour tends to produce an excess of those virtues considered most important within a given honour group. Honour systems are not conducive to prudence. To help overcome this problem, the article suggests two solutions: first, reconsidering the virtues which are considered most important in the military, to give greater weight to respect for human life and dignity; and second, broadening the honour group whose opinion soldiers value, in order to move beyond their immediate circle of comrades to encompass more fully the civilian society which they serve.

@book{Paul2000b,
abstract = {With the end of the Cold War, nuclear non-proliferation has emerged as a central issue in international security relations. While most existing works on nuclear proliferation deal with the question of nuclear acquisition, T.V. Paul explains why some states – over 185 at present – have decided to forswear nuclear weapons even when they have the technological capability or potential capability to develop them, and why some states already in possession of nuclear arms choose to dismantle them. InPower versus PrudencePaul develops a prudential-realist model, arguing that a nation's national nuclear choices depend on specific regional security contexts: the non-great power states most likely to forgo nuclear weapons are those in zones of low and moderate conflict, while nations likely to acquire such capability tend to be in zones of high conflict and engaged in protracted conflicts and enduring rivalries. He demonstrates that the choice to forbear acquiring nuclear weapons is also a function of the extent of security interdependence that states experience with other states, both allies and adversaries. He applies the comparative case study method to pairs of states with similar characteristics – Germany/Japan, Canada/Australia, Sweden/Switzerland, Argentina/Brazil – in addition to analysing the nuclear choices of South Africa, Ukraine, South Korea, India, Pakistan, and Israel. Paul concludes by questioning some of the prevailing supply side approaches to non-proliferation, offering an explication of the security variable and its linking of nuclear proliferation with protracted conflicts and enduring rivalries.Power versus Prudencewill be of interest to students of international relations, policy-makers, policy analysts, and the informed public concerned with the questions of nuclear weapons, non-proliferation, and disarmament. T.V. Paul is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science, McGill University. He has published several books and numerous articles on international security and the politics of nuclear weapons, including Asymmetric Conflicts: War Initiation by Weaker Powers, The Absolute Weapon Revisited: Nuclear Arms and the Emerging International Order, and International Order and the Future of World Politics.},

@article{Mapel1990,
abstract = {When, if ever, is the prudent statesman justified in overriding the rules of common morality? Answers to this question reflect four general orientations in political theory: moral absolutism, political realism, virtue ethics, and consequentialism. To illustrate the inadequacy of all of these views, this paper focuses on a central problem in statecraft, namely, how the statesman should interpret the requirement of "proportionality" in the conduct of war. It argues that all of these traditional views distort the nature of prudence, which must sometimes be used in choosing between conflicting values in the absence of any more general decision-rule. It concludes by arguing that a fifth position, "value pluralism," provides a more accurate understanding of the dilemmas facing the statesman.},

@article{Reichberg2010:milprudence,
abstract = {Virtually all historical treatments of just war recognize the importance of the account given by Thomas Aquinas in Summa theologiae II-II, q. 40, 'De bello', where he outlines three conditions - legitimate authority, just cause, and right intention - for a justifiable use of armed force. It is, however, less well known that within the same section of the work (q. 50, a. 4) Aquinas extended his reflection on just war into a theory of military prudence. By placing generalship under the category of 'prudence', rather than 'art' or 'science', he held that military command involves more than a morally neutral skill with victory as its sole aim. Building on the premise that service to the common good constitutes the overarching purpose of the military profession, Aquinas showed how the virtue of prudence provides an inner compass for decisionmaking amid the uncertainty and confusion of the battlefield. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

@article{Miner2000b,
abstract = {Although Aristotle undoubtedly plays a role in Thomas Aquinas's construction of a teaching on prudence, the contention of this essay is that Aquinas's notion of prudence is not fundamentally Aristotelian. After distinguishing my argument from the claim that Thomas simply misreads Aristotle, I argue that Aquinas incorporates the Aristotelian teaching as the first stratum of his own multilayered doctrine. The cumulative force of Thomas's inclusion of prudence among the quartet of cardinal virtues, his teleological elevation of prudence divine contemplation, and the placement of infused prudence within the order of charity is to suggest that Thomist prudence cannot be reduced to Aristotelian phronesis. Prudentia in Thomas, I conclude, is to be understood as human participation in divine providentia.},

abstract = {Michael Walzer's Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations is a fine work which is right to defend the “moral reality” of war and to dismiss relativist approaches. But he does not provide a defense of his position against beliefs (for example, in absolute pacificism, in revolutionary war, or in collectivist approaches) fundamentally at loggerheads with his own. If the discussion of just war is to be more than an exchange of opinions, there must be attention to ethical foundations.},
