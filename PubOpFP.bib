abstract = {The responsiveness of government policies to citizens' preferences is a central concern of various normative and empirical theories of democracy. Examining public opinion and policy data for the United States from 1935 to 1979, we find considerable congruence between changes in preferences and in policies, especially for large, stable opinion changes on salient issues. We present evidence that pubic opinion is often a proximate cause of policy, affecting policy more than policy influences opinion. One should be cautious, however, about concluding that democratic responsiveness pervades American politics.},

abstract = {This article examines relationships between media content, public opinion, and foreign policy in the United States and the United Kingdom. The investigation proceeds in two stages. First, an agenda-setting analysis demonstrates a strong connection between the salience of foreign affairs in the media and the salience of foreign affairs for the public. Second, two potential effects of varying issue salience on foreign policymaking are examined: (1) issue priming and (2) policymakers' reactions to issue salience. Analyses rely on a combination of U.S. and U.K. commercial polling data and the American National Election Study. Results point to the importance of mass media and issue salience in the relationship between public opinion and foreign policy. {\textcopyright} 2003, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

Respondents were asked for their opinionsregarding the level of funding for federal programs such as aid toeducation, defense spending, military aid to other countries, gatheringintelligence about other countries, homeland security, and the amount ofthe federal budget that does or should go toward foreign aid, as well asEuropean government funding for defense spending and economic aid toother countries. Respondents were also queried regarding their supportfor or opposition to economic aid and the types of economic aid theUnited States gives to countries such as Egypt, Israel, Russia,Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and African countries. Questions coveredUnited States troop involvement throughout the world, the need forlong-term military bases overseas, and the role that Japan and theEuropean Union play as world leaders. The topic of critical threats tothe United States was also queried, including the threat from themilitary power of Russia, economic competition from Japan, Europe, andlow-wage countries, the development of China as a world power, Islamicfundamentalism, countries with nuclear capabilities, terrorism and theuse of chemical or biological weapons, and conflicts in other parts ofthe world. Those surveyed were also asked about events that they thoughtwould justify sending United States troops to other parts of the world,including invading Iraq and overthrowing the government of SaddamHussein. Additional questions on the topic of United States militaryinvolvement included combating international terrorism through the useof such measures as air strikes, using ground troops, and assassinationof terrorist leaders. Questions sought respondent opinions on possibleU.S. foreign policy goals including the protection of weaker nations andhelping to improve their standard of living, promoting and defendinghuman rights, combating world hunger, improving the global environment,strengthening the United Nations, reducing the trade deficit, protectingAmerican business interests and promoting market economies abroad, andcontrolling and reducing illegal immigration and stopping the flow ofillegal drugs into the United States. Opinions were also gathered on theUnited States' participation in treaties to reduce global warming, banland mines, prohibit nuclear weapon tests, and establish anInternational Court to try individuals on war crimes. Additionaltopics were presented only to the general population sample.Respondents' level of interest in the actions of the government wasassessed by asking about their level of political activism, whether theyhad ever written to a public official, and whether they knew who orwhich party held particular offices. Opinion on the United Statesmilitary and its role was assessed through questions regarding the saleof military equipment to foreign countries, whether the United Statesshould have military bases overseas, and whether United States troopsshould get involved in international conflicts. Respondents were alsoqueried on the topics of globalization, trade, and the use of tariffs,as well as internationalism and the role of NATO and the European Union.Those surveyed were asked to rate their feelings toward countries suchas Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, China, France, Afghanistan, South Korea,and Brazil among others. Respondents were also asked to similarly rateAmerican and foreign leaders, such as former President Bill Clinton,Russian President Vladimir Putin, Secretary of State Colin Powell, PopeJohn Paul II, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, United NationsSecretary General Kofi Annan, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, BritishPrime Minister Tony Blair, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Israeli PrimeMinister Ariel Sharon, Palestinian Leader Yasir Arafat, and FrenchPresident Jacques Chirac, as well as institutions such as the UnitedNations, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the EuropeanUnion, and the World Court. Background information on general publicrespondents includes age, race, sex, political party, politicalorientation, political involvement, religion, marital status, spouse'semployment status, age of children in household, amount of time spent athome, employment status, occupation, position in household, education,home ownership status, and household income.

The authors use data from a general population survey of Nebraskans as a mixed-methods case study to examine public opinion of religious freedom laws. Drawing on data from both closed-ended (n = 1,117) and open-ended (n = 838) questions, the authors show that opposition to religious freedom laws is quite high, as 64 percent of respondents report that they oppose laws that would allow business owners to deny services to gay men and lesbians. The authors outline how both sides rely on frameworks that are foundational to the American experience: the protection of rights and the capitalist economy. The authors argue that these appeals to broad American values underscore why these bills will continue to be introduced and seen as controversial despite low levels of support.},

abstract = {One of the most striking findings in political science is the democratic peace: the absence of war between democracies. Some authors attempt to explain this phenomenon by highlighting the role of public opinion. They observe that democratic leaders are beholden to voters and argue that voters oppose war because of its human and financial costs. Thi logic predicts that democracies should behave peacefully in general, but history shows that democracies avoid war primarily in their relations with other democracies. In this article we investigate not whether democratic publics are averse to war in general, but whether they are especially reluctant to fight other democracies. We embedded experiments in public opinion polls in the United States and the United Kingdom and found that individuals are substantially less supportive of military strikes against democracies than against otherwise identical autocracies. Moreover, our experiments suggest that shared democracy pacifies the public primarily by changing perceptions of threat and morality, not by raising expectations of costs or failure. These findings shed light on a debate of enduring importance to scholars and policy makers. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Political Science Association.},

Substantively, we ask whether the U.S. State Department has a clear understanding of the level of cross-national religious intolerance that triggers daily headlines around the globe. Methodologically, we ask whether data on social attitudes coded from systematic qualitative reports can reliably represent cross-national public opinion. We empirically address these questions by comparing cross-national levels of religious intolerance coded from the State Department's annual international religious freedom reports with relevant population survey data from the World Values Survey and the Pew Research Center, as well as with data from written interviews of country experts conducted by the Hudson Institute. The results indicate that the understanding of social religious intolerance embodied in the State Department reports is comparable with the results of population surveys and individual expert opinion. Methodologically, this suggests that cross-national public opinion survey data can be cross-validated with coded data from systematic qualitative analysis as well as with expert opinion.

We evaluate not only the quantity but also the approaches employed by these studies.

Through a content analysis of leading political science and sociology journals from 2000 to 2010, this article considers the extent of this claim. The results show that political science publications involving religious topics have been significantly fewer than those engaging with subjects typically regarded as being more central to the discipline, and markedly less numerous than religious articles in leading sociology publications. Where political science publications have engaged with religious issues, these articles have also focused on a limited number of subject areas and been concentrated in specific disciplinary subfields. The proportion of articles covering religion has shown no real increase since the turn of the century. These findings underpin calls for political scientists to take religious issues more seriously.

abstract = { Not so very long ago, the idea of religious freedom enjoyed all the self-evident virtue of a Norman Rockwell painting. Sure, Americans disagreed about what it meant in practice, leaving their Supreme Court to hash out the details. Still, however Americans differed in their religious beliefs, they espoused religious freedom and insisted that it cannot be government's job to promote any one religious sect over others or coerce anyone's conscience in religious matters. “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,” thundered Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson in 1943, “it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” 1 For a time, this consensus seemed poised to embrace the entire world. When in November 1949 Eleanor Roosevelt proudly held up for public view a poster-size copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its article on “freedom of thought, conscience and religion,” one might have been forgiven for thinking that all the peoples of the earth were ready to follow her matronly instruction. 2 },

R ooted in moral philosophy, modern social sci-ence owes much to the reformist zeal of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. (See Figure 1 for graphic evidence.) The many pioneers in sociology, economics, and political science who had strong religious backgrounds, who often were them-selves clergy or children of clergymen, attest to the in-fluence of the Social Gospel in the early behavioral sci-ences (Blum 1956; Fox 1993; Reed 1981; Ross 1991). As political science became a professional academic disci-pline, responding to the imperatives of the academy and scientific specialization, the religious and mis-sionary zeal that characterized the early years waned (Somit and Tannenhaus 1967). Although political sci-entists in fields like political philosophy and public law continued to explore religion and public order, there was much less interest in religion among the profession as a whole, especially when the behavioral approach gained ascendance after World War II. Work on reli-gion was largely relegated to the margins of the disci-pline, not to return until the 1980s.

abstract = {Does "soft power" matter in international relations? Specifically, when the United States seeks cooperation from countries around the world, do the views of their publics about US foreign policy affect the actual foreign policy behavior of these countries? The authors examine this question using multinational surveys covering fifty-eight countries, combined with information about their foreign policy decisions in 2003, a critical year for the US. They draw their basic conceptual framework from Joseph Nye, who uses various indicators of opinion about the US to assess US soft power. But the authors argue that his theory lacks the specificity needed for falsifiable testing. They refine it by focusing on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy, an underemphasized element of Nye's approach. Their regression analysis shows that foreign public opinion has a significant and large effect on troop commitments to the war in Iraq, even after controlling for various hard power factors. It also has significant, albeit small, effects on policies toward the International Criminal Court and on voting decisions in the UN General Assembly. These results support the authors' refined theoretical argument about soft power: public opinion about US foreign policy in foreign countries does affect their policies toward the US, but this effect is conditional on the salience of an issue for mass publics.

This research, however, has often focused on a single factor at a time, rather than systematically testing the relative importance of alternative possible influences. Using extensive survey data gathered over three decades we conduct a comparative test, attempting to account for the expressed foreign policy preferences of policy makers by means of the preferences of the general public and those of several distinct sets of elites. The results of cross-sectional and time-lagged analyses suggest that U.S. foreign policy is most heavily and consistently influenced by internationally oriented business leaders, followed by experts (who, however, may themselves be influenced by business). Labor appears to have significant but smaller impacts. The general public seems to have considerably less effect, except under particular conditions. These results generally hold over several different analytical models (including two-observation time series) and different clusters of issues (economic, military, and diplomatic), with some variations across different institutional settings (the U.S. House, Senate, and executive branch).},

However, the impact of public opinion is determined not so much by the specific issues involved or by the particular pattern of public attitudes as by the domestic structure and the coalition-building processes among the elites in the respective country. The paper analyzes the public impact on the foreign policy-making process in four liberal democracies with distinct domestic structures: the United States, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan. Under the same international conditions and despite similar patterns of public attitudes, variances in foreign policy outcomes nevertheless occur; these have to be explained by differences in political institutions, policy networks, and societal structures. Thus, the four countries responded differently to Soviet policies during the 1980s despite more or less comparable trends in mass public opinion.},

The administration's mandates were challenged on under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) by employers seeking exemptions for themselves and others who conscientiously object, and the Supreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell required the administration to grant the exemptions. Of course, the administration contended and continues to contend that its mandates do not violate religious freedom or the rights of conscience, properly understood. Indeed, its defenders argue that the mandates - which contain only the narrowest of exemptions - are necessary to protect the freedom and rights of conscience of women who wish to use contraceptives and abortifacient drugs such as “Ella” (some of which they deny are actually abortion-inducing), or to avail themselves of sterilization procedures. So we find people on both sides in the debate claiming to be the defenders of liberty and conscience. It would be well for us, then, to pause to reflect in a philosophically rigorous way on the moral foundations of competing concepts of liberty and conscience. To that end, we might consider the ideas of two of modern intellectual history's most distinguished thinkers - John Stuart Mill and John Henry Newman. Mill and Newman were the greatest English intellectuals of the nineteenth century. They were men of deep and wide learning and formidable intelligence. Both wrote powerful defenses of freedom. Mill's was in the form of an essay entitled simply “On Liberty” (1859). There he defended what he described as “one very simple principle [that is] entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion.” That principle has been dubbed Mill's “harm principle:".},

abstract = {This essay takes on the broad question-what explains the political pursuits of religious actors?-by exploring two powerful influences on these pursuits The first is differentiation, or the degree of autonomy between religious actors and states in their basic authority. The second is political theology, the set of ideas that religious actors hold about political authority and justice. Through global comparisons across religions, regions, and states, it seeks to establish the effect of both influences on two political pursuits in which religion's role is hotly debated today: support for democratization and political violence, including communal violence and terrorism. It concludes with lessons learned commonly from the analysis of both pursuits.},

abstract = {Public opinion is central to representation, democratic accountability, and decision making. Yet, the public was long believed to be relatively uninterested in foreign affairs, absent an immediate threat to safety and welfare. It had become conventional to say that "voting ends at water's edge." We start the examination of the scholarly understanding of the role of foreign affairs in public opinion and voting at that low point of view. Much subsequent development saw an increasing degree of holding and using of attitudes and beliefs about foreign affairs among the public. Moving in parallel with developments in political psychology, theoretical and methodological advances led to an increasingly widely shared view that the public holds reasonably sensible and nuanced views, that these help shape their political behaviors, and that these, in turn, help shape and constrain foreign policy making.},

@incollection{Eichenberg2016,
abstract = {Scholars and governments are interested in four sets of questions concerning public opinion on foreign policy and national security policy. First, what do public opinion polls measure? How do citizens, who are generally uninformed about foreign policy and world affairs, form opinions on these matters? Second, how rational is public opinion? Is it stable or volatile? Are opinions coherent? Do opinions plausibly reflect the flow of world events? Third, what factors influence the formation of citizen opinions? Specifically, what is the impact of fundamental attitudes toward war and military force, partisanship, ideology, and gender? Finally, how universal are the determinants of citizen opinion, especially on crucial issues of war and peace? Are the findings in global comparisons the same as those in the American or European contexts? Considerable scholarship has been devoted to these four questions. Scholars now characterize public opinion as rational, in the sense that it is fairly stable, coherent, and responsive to real world events. Attitudes toward war and military force are a major focus of the research literature because many specific policy attitudes flow from fundamental views of war. Gender has also become a major focus of research because many studies find that women are less supportive of the use of military force for most purposes. Finally, scholars are beginning to discover that some opinion patterns are universal across societies, while others are more affected by the individual characteristics of national societies. Studies of global public opinion have expanded greatly, with recent scholarship focusing on global attitudes toward gender equality, immigration, and climate change.},

abstract = {If public opinion about foreign policy is such an elite-driven process, why does the public often disagree with what elites have to say? We argue here that elite cue-taking models in International Relations are both overly pessimistic and unnecessarily restrictive. Members of the public may lack information about the world around them, but they do not lack principles, and information need not only cascade from the top down. We present the results from five survey experiments where we show that cues from social peers are at least as strong as those from political elites. Our theory and results build on a growing number of findings that individuals are embedded in a social context that combines with their general orientations toward foreign policy in shaping responses toward the world around them. Thus, we suggest the public is perhaps better equipped for espousing judgments in foreign affairs than many of our top-down models claim.},

@article{Drezner2008,
abstract = {For more than half a century, realist scholars of international relations have maintained that their world view is inimical to the American public. For a variety of reasons - inchoate attitudes, national history, American exceptionalism - realists assert that the U.S. government pursues realist policies in spite and not because of public opinion. Indeed, most IR scholars share this "anti-realist assumption." To determine the empirical validity of the anti-realist assumption, this paper re-examines survey and experimental data on the mass public's attitudes towards foreign policy priorities and world views, the use of force, and foreign economic policy over the past three decades. The results suggest that, far from disliking realism, Americans are at least as comfortable with the logic of realpolitik as they are with liberal internationalism. The persistence of the anti-realist assumption might be due to an ironic fact: American elites are more predisposed towards liberal internationalism than the rest of the American public.},

abstract = {Do presidents incorporate the preferences of the public into their foreign policy decisions? Previous scholarship has begun to sketch out the sources of variation in the policy-public opinion linkage, but we still lack a clear understanding of the factors that increase or decrease presidential responsiveness. To better explore the relationship, we conceptualize presidential foreign policy making as a five-stage process - Problem representation, option generation, policy selection, implementation, and policy review - Arguing that the degree to which presidents are responsive to public opinion varies with fluctuations in public attentiveness. At stages in which public interest is high, presidents are more likely to incorporate mass preferences into their decision making than during stages of public quiescence. The key finding in our analysis of 34 foreign policy cases is that the public's "issue-attention cycle"varies systematically across foreign policy crises and noncrises. Examining these cycles of attention allows us to make predictions about the conditions under which public opinion is most likely to influence decision making. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Studies Association.},
